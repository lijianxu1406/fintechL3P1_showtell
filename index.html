        <h2>What is Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)?</h2>
        <p>GCD is a mathematical concept used to find the largest positive integer that divides 2 or more numbers without leaving a remainder. It is the greatest number that can divide all of the given numbers evenly. It is also sometimes known as the "Greatest Common Factor" or "Highest Common Factor".</p>

        <h2>Applications in Mathematics</h2>
        <p>GCD has various applications in mathematics, including simplifying fractions and solving diophantine equations. There are various methods to calculate the GCD, such as the Euclidean algorithm, which is widely used and efficient technique for finding the GCD of 2 numbers.</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>Some of the key benefits of additive manufacturing are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced material wastage</li>
            <li>Customization and personalization</li>
            <li>Shorter production lead times</li>
            <li>Complex geometries achievable</li>
        </ul>
